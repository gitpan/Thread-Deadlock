	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

	Removed mention of AutoLoader from the pod.

0.05	13 August 2003
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Removed "our"
	from $VERSION as per my other Thread::xxx modules.  Now uses "load"
	instead of AutoLoader, added dependency to Makefile.PL.

	Made sure test-suite runs with strict and warnings enabled.  Added
	message for strange warnings that seem to emanate out of Test::More.

0.04	31 August 2002
        Changed module to use AutoLoader to defer loading of necessary
	subroutines to when they are actually needed.  This should save
	memory and CPU for larger programs, or with large numbers of threads.

	30 August 2002
	Setting shorten to true now also removes (autosplit...) text.

0.03	29 August 2002
	Added trace capability, settable with the trace class method.

	Argh.  Apparently introduced some errors just before uploading.
	Should be all fixed now.

0.02	29 August 2002
	Robert Soderberg had some suggestions ;-)

	Added "off" (and "on") class methods for switching reporting off (or
	on) for a specific thread and all the threads that are created there.
	
	Renamed method "report" to "output": "report" now returns a
	preliminary report.
	
	Added support for different output formats, "plain" and "xml", and
	added "format" to allow you to select the type.  Added "encoding"
	method for specifying encoding if XML type is used.

	Added support for summary, which can be selected with the new
	"summary" class method.

	Added support for limiting numbers of elements in the stacktrace and
	a class method "callers" to specify that number.

	Added support for shortening package names and a class method "shorten"
	to specify that setting.

	Added "disable" class method for disabling automatic report generation
	upon exit of the program.

	Now only reports threads that were actually running when the last
	checkpoint was done.  This should give a better approximation to
	reporting only live threads.

	Fixed some typo's here.

0.01	28 August 2002
	First version of Thread::Deadlock;
