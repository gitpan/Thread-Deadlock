README for Thread::Deadlock

Sourcefilter for grabbing all occurrences of lock(), cond_wait(), cond_signal()
and cond_broadcast() which allows you to find out where all threads are located
when a program is stopped.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.
