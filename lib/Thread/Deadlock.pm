=head1 DESCRIPTION

                  *** A note of CAUTION ***

 This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.
 And then only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It
 is of no use with any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without
 threads enabled.

                  *************************

The Thread::Deadlock module allows you to find out B<where> your threaded
application may be deadlocked.  It does B<not> prevent any deadlocks, nor is
it capable of resolving any deadlocks.

If you use the Thread::Deadlock module, all occurences of cond_wait(),
cond_signal() and cond_broadcast() in the source are checkpointed to
remember where it was exactly in your source and where it was in the execution
stack.  When your program finishes (either as intended or after you killed the
program, e.g. by pressing Control-C), then a report will be generated for each
thread, indicating where each thread had its last checkpoint.  By default, this
report is written to STDERR, but can be redirected to a file of your choice.

On top of this, it is also possible to have a trace generated of each time
a cond_wait(), cond_signal() or cond_broadcast() was called.  This may give
additional information as to how a problem such as a deadlock, can occur.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

There are only class methods.  The class methods L<summary>, L<callers>,
L<shorten>, L<format>, L<encoding>, L<output> and L<trace> methods can also
be called as fields in a parameter hash with C<use>.

=head2 on

 Thread::Deadlock->on;

The "on" class method switches reporting B<on> for the current thread and any
threads that are created from this thread.

=head2 off

 Thread::Deadlock->off;

The "off" class method switches reporting B<off> for the current thread and
any threads that are created from this thread.

=head2 summary

 Thread::Deadlock->summary( 'auto' );  # default, automatic

 Thread::Deadlock->summary( 0 );       # don't do summary

 Thread::Deadlock->summary( 1 );       # always do summary

 $summary = Thread::Deadlock->summary;

The "summary" class method sets and returns whether a thread summary will be
added to the report.  By default, a summary will be added if there are at least
two threads at the same location in the source.

=head2 callers

 Thread::Deadlock->callers( 4 );       # default, return 4 callers
 
 Thread::Deadlock->callers( 0 );       # return all callers

 $callers = Thread::Deadlock->callers;

The "callers" class method sets and returns the number of callers that should
be shown in the report.  By default, only 4 callers will be shown.

=head2 shorten

 Thread::Deadlock->shorten( 1 );       # default, shorten
 
 Thread::Deadlock->shorten( 0 );       # do not shorten package names

 $shorten = Thread::Deadlock->shorten;

The "shorten" class method sets and returns whether package names should be
shortened in the dump.  By default, package names will be shortened, to create
a more readable report.

=head2 format

 Thread::Deadlock->format( 'plain' );  # default, make plain text report

 Thread::Deadlock->format( 'xml' );    # make xml report

 $format = Thread::Deadlock->format;

The "format" class method sets and returns the format in which the report
will be generated.  By default, the report will be created in plain text.
If you select 'xml', you may want to change the L<encoding> setting of the
XML that will be generated.

=head2 encoding

 Thread::Deadlock->encoding( 'iso-latin-1' );  # default

 $encoding = Thread::Deadlock->encoding;

The "encoding" class method sets and returns the encoding in which the report
will be generated if B<xml> was selected as the L<format>.  By default, the
report will be created in 'ISO-Latin-1' encoding.
 
=head2 report

 $report = Thread::Deadlock->report;

The "report" class method returns the report that is otherwise automatically
created when the program finishes.  It can be used for creation of
intermediate reports.  It can be called by _any_ thread.

=head2 output

 Thread::Deadlock->output( 'filename' );  # write to specific file

 $output = Thread::Deadlock->output;      # obtain current setting

The "output" class method returns the current setting for the thread
checkpoint report.  It can also be used to set the name of the file to which
the report will be written.  Call L<disable> to disable reporting.

The strings "STDOUT" and "STDERR" can be used to indicate standard output and
standard error respectively.

=head2 disable

 Thread::Deadlock->disable;

The "disable" class method disables reporting altogether.  This can be handy
if your program has completed successfully and you're not interested in a
report.

=head2 trace

 Thread::Deadlock->trace( 'filename');    # start tracing to specific file

 $trace = Thread::Deadlock->trace;

The "trace" class method sets and returns the filename to which a trace will
be appended.  By default, no tracing occurs in which case C<undef> will be
returned.  Call L<untrace> to disable tracing for B<all> threads.

The strings "STDOUT" and "STDERR" can be used to indicate standard output and
standard error respectively.

=head2 disable

 Thread::Deadlock->untrace;

The "untrace" class method disables tracing for B<all> threads.  This can be
handy if there are sections in your program that you do not want to have
traced.

=head1 OPTIMIZATIONS

This module uses L<AutoLoader> to reduce memory and CPU usage. This causes
subroutines only to be compiled in a thread when they are actually needed at
the expense of more CPU when they need to be compiled.  Simple benchmarks
however revealed that the overhead of the compiling single routines is not
much more (and sometimes a lot less) than the overhead of cloning a Perl
interpreter with a lot of subroutines pre-loaded.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module was originally conceived as hi-jacking the core lock() function.
However, this proved to be impossible, at least with Perl 5.8.0.  It was
therefore re-written to hi-jack the cond_wait(), cond_signal() and
cond_broadcast() routines from threads::shared.pm.  This is not exactly the
same, but since most deadlocking problems are caused by mixups of cond_wait()
and cond_signal()/cond_broadcast(), this seems to be as good a solution.
